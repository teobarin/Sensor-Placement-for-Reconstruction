## Description

The success of predictive models and controllers in engineering and natural processes is largely determined
by critical in situ measurements and feedback from sensors. However, the deployment of sensors into complex
environments, such as manufacturing, geophysical, and biological processes, is often expensive and
challenging. This project aims to implements algorithms for data-driven sparse sensor placement optimization
for reconstruction and to understand the mathematical algorithms and theory for sparse sensor optimization,
and to carry out some simple demonstration of the features implemented.
